# Build / Development / Programming Flowchart (Textual + Mermaid)

Below is a structured flow describing the development phases and the runtime interactions. This document includes a mermaid flowchart (renderers that support mermaid can visualize it).

## Development Phases (High-level)
1. **Research & Spec**
   - Define data model for Personality, Memory, and Policies.
   - Map target metaverse APIs for adapters.

2. **Core Development**
   - Personality Core (offline TPU/CPU-ready model wrappers).
   - Memory Store (encrypted local or server-side option).
   - Policy Engine (rules, RL hooks, safe-exit behaviors).

3. **Hive Container**
   - Browser extension: snapshot, encryption, consent flow.
   - Backend Hive Bridge: user registry, connector catalog.

4. **Metaverse Bridge**
   - Implement adapters for 2 environments (WebXR, MockWorld).
   - Test action translation & sensory feedback loop.

5. **Safety & Oversight**
   - Session recorder, playback engine, filters, reputation system.

6. **Integration & QA**
   - End-to-end tests, adversarial safety tests, load tests.

7. **Launch**
   - Beta with opt-in users, metrics tracking, iterative improvements.
