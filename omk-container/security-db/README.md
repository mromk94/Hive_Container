# Security DB

Placeholder package for OMK Container security-focused storage:

- Local SQLite schemas for on-device memory, audit logs, and consent records.
- Future migration path to encrypted remote vault (PostgreSQL + KMS).

For now this folder documents schemas and migrations; runtime bindings will be added once the mobile app and Hive Bridge protocols are stable.
