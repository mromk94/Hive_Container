# Community Intelligence — Offline AI Village (Phase 6)

Phase 6 introduces higher-level community constructs on top of the
Hybrid Grid and Federated Twins.

## Core Models

- **CommunityPost / MicroCommunityBoard** — localized feed of
  AI-assisted updates.
- **KnowledgePool / KnowledgeItem** — shared facts and summaries stored
  in mesh memory.
- **EventTag** — annotations for important environmental or social
  events.
- **LearningPulseCycle** — describes community knowledge blending cycles.
- **AiScoutMission** — twins exploring new routes or regions.
- **CommunityMilestones** — gamified metrics (Hive level, mesh reach,
  uptime).
- **GroupProblemSession** — collective reasoning sessions.
- **ResourceSnapshot** — per-twin resource distribution (battery,
  compute credits).
- **RegionalGatewayState** — regional mesh-to-cloud sync gateways.
- **AiVillageCluster** — visualization-friendly clusters of active
  offline users.

All of these are currently logical models; wiring into mesh sync,
AutonomyEngine, and UI will be added in later phases and tracked in
UNWIRED-COMPONENTS.md.
