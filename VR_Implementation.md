# VR_Implementation-Flow — Technical Design & Development Plan

## Overview
A technical blueprint for integrating Hive Container Personality Snapshots into an immersive VR engine (Unity/Unreal) with real-time AI behavior orchestration, secure bridging, and multi-user support.

---

## System Components (technical)
1. **Hive Container (Client Extension)**
   - Responsibilities: local encryption, snapshot management, consent UI.
   - Interfaces: REST + WebSocket to backend; browser extension / OS-integrated client.
2. **Personality Core (AI Service)**
   - Lightweight local runtime for low-latency actions + cloud inference for heavy generation.
   - Modules: Dialogue engine, Behavior policy, Memory store, Learning updater.
3. **AIverse Engine (VR Server + Renderer)**
   - Worlds hosted on Unity/Unreal. Client app on headset or WebXR-capable browser.
   - Runtime loads Personality manifests to instantiate AI agents & adapt environment.
4. **Bridge & Adapter Layer**
   - Translates Personality outputs (intents, gestures) into engine controls or API calls.
   - Formats sensory inputs (events, chat, environment signals) back to Personality Core.
5. **Session Recorder & Playback**
   - Event log, snapshot diffs, audio/video captures, and transcript generator.
6. **Storage & Indexing**
   - Encrypted object store (S3) for snapshots & recordings, Postgres for metadata, Redis for event bus.
7. **Auth & Security**
   - OAuth2 / JWT for user sessions. Hive Proof-of-Consent handshake for cross-site identity.
8. **Realtime Comms**
   - WebSocket / gRPC for low-latency control messages; WebRTC for P2P voice & optional video.

## Tech Stack Recommendation
- **VR Engine**: Unity (C#) or Unreal (C++) — Unity recommended for faster iteration and WebXR support.
- **Backend**: Node.js / TypeScript + NestJS for APIs; Python (FastAPI) for ML microservices.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for metadata; encrypted object store (S3-compatible) for blobs.
- **Cache / Event Bus**: Redis Streams or NATS for high throughput eventing.
- **Realtime**: Socket.IO or uWebSockets for stable HMD client connections; WebRTC for voice.
- **Model infra**: On-device TinyLM or Llama-family distilled models; cloud-hosted larger models (OpenAI / self-hosted) for heavy tasks.
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI, with automated tests and canary deployments.

## Data Flow (Runtime)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant H as Hive Extension (Client)
  participant V as VR Client (HMD)
  participant B as Bridge API
  participant P as Personality Core (AI)
  participant S as Storage / Recorder

  H->>B: Upload Snapshot metadata (consent)
  V->>B: Request to launch session (with Snapshot ID)
  B->>P: Instantiate Personality (load snapshot)
  P->>B: Ready (initial state)
  B->>V: Spawn AI Agent manifest
  V->>P: Environment events (collisions, proximity, chat)
  P->>V: Action commands (dialogue, gesture, movement)
  V->>S: Stream session events & media
  S->>H: Provide playback summary for user
