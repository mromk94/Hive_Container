- Date: 2025-10-30
- Working directory: /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/Hive_container

## Entries
- 20:42 Created Blueprint.md with vision, architecture, and modular TODOs.
- 20:45 Setup extension structure: created hive-extension/{package.json, tsconfig.json, manifest.json, icons/.gitkeep}.
- 20:47 Implemented src/types.ts and src/background.ts skeleton; added message routes and token stub.

- 20:56 Added demo/index.html to exercise handshake end-to-end.
- 20:58 Added origin validation in background for APP_FORWARD_REQUEST; contentScript now passes page origin.
- 21:00 Fixed TS lint: ensured types.ts is a module; added chrome declaration and param types in background.
- 21:02 Ran npm install in hive-extension (dev deps: esbuild, typescript, @types/chrome).

## Notes
- 21:10 Guidance: In Chrome "Load unpacked", select the extension root folder `hive-extension` (the one that contains `manifest.json`). Do not select `demo/` or `index.html` — Chrome requires the folder with `manifest.json`.
- 21:11 If opening `demo/index.html` as file://, enable the extension option "Allow access to file URLs" so the content script runs on the demo page.
- 21:14 Fixed load error: removed missing icon declarations from manifest.json and icons from web_accessible_resources. Reload the extension in chrome://extensions.
- 21:15 Added .gitignore (ignore .DS_Store, node_modules, dist). Preparing to commit and push initial extension scaffold.
- 21:16 Committed scaffold and blueprint/logs/path to git.
- 21:17 Pushed to origin/main (commit 5d6c58f).
- 21:20 Added ES256 WebCrypto utility (crypto.ts) for keypair and signing.
- 21:21 Updated ClientSignedToken type to include alg.
- 21:22 Integrated ES256 signing into background token creation.
- 21:23 Rebuilt extension; dist/background.js updated.
- 21:26 Committing ES256 signing changes and updated background/types.
- 21:27 Pushed ES256 signing changes to origin/main.
- 21:30 Added single-use toggle in popup and passed to token creation.
- 21:31 Implemented session revocation API and single-use enforcement in background (with used-token tracking).
- 21:32 Rebuilt extension; background and popup bundles updated.
- 21:34 Added README for hive-extension with features, setup, demo, security, permissions, roadmap.
- 21:36 Added src/config.ts with origin allowlist helpers.
- 21:37 Narrowed host_permissions and content_script matches in manifest.json to localhost + file URLs.
- 21:38 Enforced allowlist checks in background for token creation and forwarding.
- 21:39 Rebuilt extension; background updated with allowlist checks.
- 21:41 Fixed popup race: store pending session in storage before opening popup; popup reads and clears on load.
- 21:42 Updated contentScript to postMessage with '*' to support file:// pages; rebuild successful.
- 21:43 Reminder: Reload extension and ensure "Allow access to file URLs" is enabled for the demo.
- 21:45 Normalized appOrigin and postMessage targets in demo to support file:// (use '*' and 'file://').
- 21:46 Normalized origin in contentScript for forward requests and used '*' for approved/forward responses.
- 21:47 Rebuilt extension (contentScript + demo adjustments).
- 21:50 Added provider registry UI in popup (selector + token save/clear) and background routing via registry.
- 21:52 Implemented Gemini forwarder in background (map OpenAI-style messages to Gemini generateContent).
- 21:53 Updated manifest host_permissions to allow generativelanguage.googleapis.com.
- 21:54 Rebuilt extension with Gemini support.
- 21:56 Observation: Forward success with echo path on provider=gemini (no API key saved). Guidance: save Gemini key in popup Provider Settings, then Connect → Approve → Forward again.
- 22:00 Added Claude forwarder (Anthropic /v1/messages) and manifest host_permissions for api.anthropic.com.
- 22:02 Added HIVE_DEBUG_INFO endpoint in background and Debug Info button in popup.
- 22:03 Applied black & gold styling to popup (luxury theme).
- 22:04 Rebuilt extension; background and popup updated.
- 22:30 Added Gemini v1→v1beta fallback with detailed tried/usedUrl in background; initial 404s observed for default aliases.
- 22:45 Implemented Preferred Model UI in popup and HIVE_LIST_MODELS endpoint; background respects preferred first.
- 23:00 Implemented auto-discovery via ListModels and auto-cache of successful model; no manual copy needed thereafter.
- 23:10 Styled demo to black/gold and added Forward debug panels (usedUrl, tried) for quick verification.
- 23:15 Suppressed background error when popup not open (consume lastError) and bumped manifest version to 0.1.1.
- 23:20 Rebuilt extension; verified successful forward with gemini-2.5-pro.
- 23:25 Committed changes (preferred model UI, auto-discovery, demo UI, fixes) and pushed to origin/main.
 - 23:35 Implemented Local provider forwarder (tries common endpoints, returns usedUrl/tried, honors single-use).
 - 23:40 Encrypted provider tokens at rest (AES-GCM vault key) and routed background to use encrypted getter.
 - 23:45 Popup UI: added secure storage indicator, dynamic token label (Local → Base URL), human-friendly copy.
 - 23:50 Popup styling upgraded to 3D/animated luxury black & gold; hover/active depth, soft glows.
 - 23:55 Added dev watch scripts (watch:bg/cs/popup, watch) and installed npm-run-all.
 - 23:58 Fixed lint/structure issues: removed misplaced Local block from HIVE_LIST_MODELS; consolidated Local forwarding under APP_FORWARD_REQUEST.
 - 00:05 Demo UX: added loading/steps animation and human-friendly response card with provider/model badges; technical details collapsed.
 - 00:12 Core Vision logged: Portable Persona + Handshake + Shared Consciousness Loop. Summary:
   - Portable persona travels across the web and conditions site AIs upon user approval (origin-scoped).
   - Handshake protocol lets a site request persona, suggest replies, and update context.
   - Shared memory loop maintains rolling transcript and preferences per origin + global.
   - Privacy controls: allowlist/denylist and on-page active banner with quick toggle.
 - 00:13 Next Steps decided:
   1) Persona Profile schema + encrypted storage + popup editor (sliders + notes).
   2) Handshake Protocol v1: GET_PERSONA, SUGGEST_REPLY, UPDATE_CONTEXT with approvals.
   3) Generic Chat Adapter v1: floating “Ask My Hive” near textareas, suggestion panel.
   4) Shared memory per session/origin; inject into provider prompts.
   5) Privacy controls (allow/deny + quick toggle UI).
 - 00:18 Demo fix: removed TS-style "as" cast from escapeHtml to resolve `Unexpected identifier 'as'`; added safe mini-markdown renderer and upgraded token UI to 3D card with mask/copy.

- 13:30 Demo: Added inline cinematic prologue with persona-aware typewriter + particles. Later hardened fallback and slowed speed.
- 13:45 Handshake v1: Implemented HIVE_SUGGEST_REPLY in background, bridged via contentScript; Demo added Suggest Replies UI.
- 14:05 Performance: Added fetch timeouts, reduced tokens, raced endpoints (Gemini v1/v1beta; Local endpoints) for faster suggestions.
- 14:20 Diagnostics: Content script surfaces runtime.lastError back to page to avoid silent hangs.
- 14:35 Popup UX: Introduced 2-tab layout — Chat (default) and Config (existing settings). Chat panel streams via HIVE_POPUP_CHAT.
- 14:36 Background: Added HIVE_POPUP_CHAT (provider-backed chat with persona system) and HIVE_UPDATE_CONTEXT (rolling events per origin/session).
- 14:38 Popup: Wired tab switching and minimal chat send; messages render in chat log.

### 2025-11-01
- 01:25 Continuity: Added buildMemorySummary and buildMemoryMessages; HIVE_PULL_MEMORY now returns hydrated messages for rehydration.
- 01:32 Popup Refresh: replaces chat with hydrated thread from memory instead of summary text.
- 01:36 Memory Recording: Popup now records user messages, assistant replies, import events, and insert actions with origin tags.
- 01:40 UI (Config): Added toggle “Capture page chat to Hive” persisted as hive_capture_page.
- 01:42 Page Bubble: Added “Hydrate” button to inject short recent context preface (no auto-send).
- 01:44 Page Capture: Minimal user send capture on sendAttempt when toggle ON.
- 01:46 Assistant Capture: MutationObserver for OpenAI; later extended to Gemini and Claude heuristics; dedupe by trimmed key.

- 03:08 Behavior: Added "Auto-hydrate on focus" toggle and page-side focus sync via HIVE_SYNC.
- 03:12 Vision: Added "Allow page reading (vision)" toggle. When ON, requests optional host permission for current origin and injects content script.
- 03:14 Read Button: Added "Read" in on-page bubble to inject Deep Page Context (title, selection, summary of text blocks, and images: alt/caption/src), with hash dedupe.
- 03:16 Suggest Flow: When page reading is allowed, suggestions prepend SYSTEM page snapshot automatically.
- 03:18 Manifest: Expanded optional_host_permissions to http(s)://*/* for per-site opt-in; kept content_script matches narrow. Uses chrome.scripting.executeScript on grant.
- 03:20 Mobile Bridge: Added window.postMessage relays HIVE_MOBILE_SYNC/PULL/RECORD to support external mobile surfaces.
- 05:20 Chat UX: Multiline composer (Shift+Enter newline), Output format selector (Plain/Markdown/HTML), markdown/html rendering with sanitization.

- 05:34 Popup: Auto-detect embedded and switch to responsive full-height layout (flex chat + sticky composer).
- 05:38 Compact UI: Consolidated floating controls into single side tab with compact action menu; hid banner/bubble by default.
- 05:45 Detection: Added manual “Rescan AI” and visual cue (tab glow) when AI detected.
- 05:52 Manifest: Added host_permissions and content_script matches for copilot.microsoft.com, *.bing.com, grok.com, elevenlabs.io, *.elevenlabs.io, www/meta.ai, www/*.canva.com.
- 05:58 Manifest (more): Added github.com, *.github.com, and new-frontend-irt9943l2-adolphuslarrygmailcoms-projects.vercel.app.
- 05:59 ContentScript: Console debug on injection; expanded knownHosts list accordingly.
- 06:00 Build: npm run build succeeded (background/contentScript/popup bundles updated). Reload extension to test.
