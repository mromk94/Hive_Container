# LOGS — Hive Container (Chrome Extension)

- Date: 2025-10-30
- Working directory: /Users/mac/CascadeProjects/Hive_container

## Entries
- 20:42 Created Blueprint.md with vision, architecture, and modular TODOs.
- 20:45 Setup extension structure: created hive-extension/{package.json, tsconfig.json, manifest.json, icons/.gitkeep}.
- 20:47 Implemented src/types.ts and src/background.ts skeleton; added message routes and token stub.
- 20:52 Added src/contentScript.ts bridge (page <-> extension) and src/popup.{html,ts} consent UI.
- 20:54 Updated build script to copy popup.html to dist; prepared for npm install + build.
- 20:56 Added demo/index.html to exercise handshake end-to-end.
- 20:58 Added origin validation in background for APP_FORWARD_REQUEST; contentScript now passes page origin.
- 21:00 Fixed TS lint: ensured types.ts is a module; added chrome declaration and param types in background.
- 21:02 Ran npm install in hive-extension (dev deps: esbuild, typescript, @types/chrome).
- 21:05 Ran npm run build → generated dist/background.js, dist/contentScript.js, dist/popup.js and copied popup.html.

## Notes
- 21:10 Guidance: In Chrome "Load unpacked", select the extension root folder `hive-extension` (the one that contains `manifest.json`). Do not select `demo/` or `index.html` — Chrome requires the folder with `manifest.json`.
- 21:11 If opening `demo/index.html` as file://, enable the extension option "Allow access to file URLs" so the content script runs on the demo page.
- 21:14 Fixed load error: removed missing icon declarations from manifest.json and icons from web_accessible_resources. Reload the extension in chrome://extensions.
- 21:15 Added .gitignore (ignore .DS_Store, node_modules, dist). Preparing to commit and push initial extension scaffold.
- 21:16 Committed scaffold and blueprint/logs/path to git.
- 21:17 Pushed to origin/main (commit 5d6c58f).
- 21:20 Added ES256 WebCrypto utility (crypto.ts) for keypair and signing.
- 21:21 Updated ClientSignedToken type to include alg.
- 21:22 Integrated ES256 signing into background token creation.
- 21:23 Rebuilt extension; dist/background.js updated.
- 21:26 Committing ES256 signing changes and updated background/types.
- 21:27 Pushed ES256 signing changes to origin/main.
