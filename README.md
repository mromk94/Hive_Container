# AI‑verse Ecosystem (by mromk94)

This repository is part of a modular, multi‑repo ecosystem implementing the AI‑verse vision and the Shared Consciousness Protocol (SCp). Together, these repos form a layered system:

- **AIverse‑Hub** — Vision & Protocol (SCp). The constitution that defines the what and why, the architecture (Axons, Nexus, Core), and the rules of the ecosystem.
- **omakh‑Hive** — Infrastructure Nexus. The decentralized task market and orchestration layer. Axons (agents) register skills and pick up tasks ("pollen"). A Queen component coordinates and delegates.
- **scout94** — Reference Axon (Agent). A practical worker agent that can browse, interact with files, and execute code; designed to plug into the Hive and execute tasks.
- **Hive_Container** — Runtime/DevOps. Ops tooling to compose and run the ecosystem across local and cloud environments. (This repo)

New entry: AI‑verse & the Shared Consciousness Protocol (SCp)
- Subject: a decentralized, multi‑agent AI ecosystem by mromk94.
- Core idea: multiple independent agents collaborate as a collective intelligence.
- Status: functional prototype spanning protocol (AI‑verse), infrastructure (omakh‑Hive), and an agent (scout94).
- Significance: a practical, layered path toward AI coordination and task delegation.

# Hive Container — Continuity and Consent Layer

Canonical continuity layer for AI-Verse. Provides local encryption, Personality Snapshot lifecycle, and client-signed Proof-of-Consent tokens to authorize AI-Verse sessions in external worlds.

- Canonical name: Hive Container
- Upstream project: AI-Verse (https://github.com/mromk94/AIverse-Hub)
- Terminology reference: [AI-Verse Glossary](https://github.com/mromk94/AIverse-Hub/blob/main/docs/GLOSSARY.md)

## Responsibilities
- Local key management and encrypted Personality Snapshots
- Consent UX and ephemeral `ClientSignedToken`
- Snapshot versioning, export/import, selective redaction
- Bridge Registry client (list adapters/worlds)

## Architecture Overview
- Extension/App: Key custody, consent UI, snapshot manager
- Bridge Registry/API: discovery and minimal metadata exchange
- AI-Verse: consumes consented snapshots to launch sessions and spawn agents

### Data Contracts (canonical)
- ClientSignedToken
```json
{
  "sessionId": "hive_ab12cd34",
  "sub": "user_abc",
  "scopes": ["persona.use", "memory.read.limited"],
  "iat": 1712345000,
  "exp": 1712346800,
  "origin": "https://world.example",
  "signature": "base64(signature)"
}
```

## Integration Summary
- Hive Container issues consent tokens and manages encrypted snapshots.
- AI-Verse validates tokens, loads snapshots (never raw memories), and orchestrates sessions.
- Adapters translate intents to world actions; Recorder logs events for audit/playback.

## Naming
- Use “AI-Verse” consistently when referring to the upstream platform.

## Continuity & Sync Orchestrator (WIP)

This extension now provides a local continuity layer that captures and hydrates conversation context across surfaces.

Shipped continuity features:
- Hydrated prompts in popup chat and suggest: persona + recent memory thread prepended to requests.
- Popup Refresh replaces chat with hydrated messages from local memory.
- Page capture (toggle): user sends and assistant replies recorded into local memory with origin tagging.
- On‑page Hydrate button inserts a short “Recent context” preface (no auto‑send).
- Loop safeguards: insert/send dedupe; hash‑based dedupe for context/persona prefaces.

Planned orchestrator (design):
- HiveMemoryVault
  - persona: object
  - lastConversationHash: string
  - lastMessage: string
  - threadHistory: Array<{ role:'user'|'assistant', content:string, ts:number }>
  - syncTimestamp: number
- Sync worker (runs on: popup open, message send, refresh, idle heartbeat)
  - Compute last_state_hash from threadHistory/persona snapshot.
  - If incoming hash differs and newer → pull into local memory and hydrate surfaces.
  - If local newer → push to Vault (cloud backup forthcoming) and mark syncTimestamp.
  - Arbitration: prefer user‑authored updates; break ties by latest ts; never treat GPT output as user intent.

Cloud backup is planned as an optional, end‑to‑end encrypted Vault for redundancy and cross‑device continuity.
