Adapter Design (Bridge)

Intent Layer: Personality outputs normalized to INTENT {type, target, confidence, params}.

Control Layer: Adapter translates intents to engine APIs (moveTo, speak, animate, buyItem, openDialog).

Safety Layer: Policy enforcement — blocks intents over thresholds (e.g., spending > cap).

Backoff & Retry: For failed actions, adapter requests fallback behaviors from Personality Core.

Example INTENT payload
{
  "intent_id": "dialogue_329",
  "type": "speak",
  "target": "user",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "params": {"text":"I found an exhibit you might like.", "voice_profile":"calm_female_v2"}
}

World / Rendering Performance Considerations

Predictive Rendering: Preload likely assets based on next-intents.

LOD & Occlusion: Aggressive LOD switching and occlusion culling for mobile VR.

Edge Caching: Edge nodes for low-latency asset delivery.

Batched Events: Aggregate small events to reduce chattiness.

Multi-user & Networking

Authority model: Server-authoritative positions for NPCs and important events; client-validated UI actions.

Sync: State diffing and authoritative reconciliation; event time-stamps for causal ordering.

Scale: Shard worlds by hub and capacity; use interest management (only replicate objects near users).

Security & Privacy Implementation

Key Management: Client-side generated keys; server only stores encrypted blobs and cannot decrypt without user consent.

Consent Flow: Hive Proof-of-Consent handshake — explicit user approval when exposing actions to third-party adapters.

Auditability: Immutable session logs with tamper-evident metadata (hash chaining).

Rate Limits & Budgeting: Spending budgets and action quotas to prevent rogue behavior.

CI / Testing Strategy

Unit Tests: For adapter translation, policy enforcement, snapshot importers.

Integration Tests: Simulated worlds with mock personalities.

Performance Tests: Headless client bots in Unity to simulate load.

Safety Tests: Adversarial prompts and environment fuzzing.

Deployment Plan & Timeline (MVP-focused)

Phase 0 — Plan & Spec (Weeks 0–2)

Finalize data model, API contracts, and minimal persona schema.

Phase 1 — Core PoC (Weeks 3–10)

Build simple Unity sandbox world (single hub + one personal realm).

Implement Hive Snapshot import/export (local encryption).

Implement Personality Core (text-only LLM + simple policy engine).

Basic bridge adapter and a local WebSocket connection.

Phase 2 — Interaction & Voice (Weeks 11–18)

Add TTS, lip-sync, and spatial audio.

Proxy mode for scripted events and session recorder.

Simple wallet mock and spending cap enforcement.

Phase 3 — Social & Scale (Weeks 19–30)

Multi-user hubs, interest-management, backend scaling.

Asset marketplace MVP, trust/reputation signals.

UI polish and accessibility features.

Phase 4 — Alpha & Feedback (Weeks 31–38)

Private alpha with opt-in testers.

Safety audits, legal/compliance checks, KYC flow finalization.

API Surface (Sample endpoints)

POST /api/v1/snapshots — upload encrypted snapshot metadata (client uploads encrypted blob separately).

GET /api/v1/bridges — list available metaverse adapters.

POST /api/v1/sessions — launch session in a world (body: snapshot_id, world_id, mode).

WS /ws/sessions/{session_id} — real-time event channel.

GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/playback — fetch recording & highlights.

Safety Policies & Governance

Default autonomy = low. Explicit user opt-in for higher autonomy.

Marketplace transactions require multi-factor approval if above user threshold.

Moderation: community reporting + automated behavior detection + human review.

Monitoring & Observability

Telemetry: session durations, intent rates, intervention rates.

Logs: action logs with hashes for audit.

Alerts: unusual spending, repeated unsafe intents, or high manual takeover rates.

Sample Milestones & Deliverables (summary)

Week 6: Demo — local Unity scene + Hive snapshot + AI chat.

Week 12: Alpha — voice + simple proxy events + playback.

Week 20: Social beta — multi-user hub, basic marketplace.

Week 38: Public alpha with safety & compliance pass.

Appendix: Development Risks & Mitigations

Risk: High latency for LLM responses in VR → Mitigation: local distilled models + caching and speculative generation.

Risk: Privacy leaks → Mitigation: default offline-first storage, client-only decryption.

Risk: Unintended AI decisions → Mitigation: strict policy engine, human-in-loop, and emergency stop.
